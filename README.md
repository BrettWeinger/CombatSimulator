# CombatSimulator
HTML, CSS, &amp; JavaScript code for Combat Simulator project.
Modeling KingsIsle Entertainment's system in its MMORPG,
the Combat Simulator essentially replicates an encounter
and repeats it enough times to draw conclusions and make viable recommendations.
The theory behind the project is,
given a rather complex situation with far too many
variables, factors, and randomness to mathematically calculate,
a program can be devised to statistically obtain a remarkably close solution.
